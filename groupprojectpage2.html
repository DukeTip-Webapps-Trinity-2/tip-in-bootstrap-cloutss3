    <h1>Residence Life at Duke TIP

</html>

<p>Life at Duke Tip is full of fun activities for people to do. The excellent dining halls serve as locations for your meals,
    while the whole camp will sleep in one dorm. You will have a roomate and two suitemates that you share a bathroom with.
    Evening activities include sports/outside options, trivia, music, and other options. You will have a dance every week
    and weekend activities as well. Life at tip is a lot of fun.
</p>
<p>Some suggestions include always being on time, and try to follow the rules because you only get one warning. Also, make the
    best of everything. Also, go to bed at lights out because the residential counselors on night duty will knock on your
    door.</p>
